/*
To support error handling, Promise objects provide a catch() method.
This is a lot like then(): you call it and pass in a handler function.
However, while the handler passed to then() is called when the asynchronous operation succeeds, 
the handler passed to catch() is called when the asynchronous operation fails.

If you add catch() to the end of a promise chain, 
then it will be called when any of the asynchronous function calls fails. 
So you can implement an operation as several consecutive asynchronous function calls, 
and have a single place to handle all errors.
